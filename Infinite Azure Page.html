							<p>For my Invidual Project I was required to create a game related project due to picking the Games Technology pathway. Looking at previous project examples I wanted to do something unique and do something creative with the equipment I have.
							So I developed a 3D FPS game that has randomly generated content along with VR support in Unity using C#. This was my first ever project of this size and with VR. As someone who is keen in going into the game industry, VR was something that I really 
							enjoyed working with. Most of the assets within the project was taken from Free 3D models that were available to use commercially or for educational purposes.</p>
							<p>The project took a few months and prior to starting this I had basic knowledge in Unity and VR Development. The VR Headset used for the creation of this project is the HTC Vive Pro so I had to use the OpenVR Plugin. <b>As a note, this project is only built for Windows OS along with HTC VR Headsets. The project can be built for MacOS but has not been tested and may run into compatibility issues.</b></p>
							<p>The game includes many features such as: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Randomly generated levels using an algorithm</li>
								<li>Various NPCs using NavMeshComponent and FSM</li>
								<li>VR Mode</li>
								<li>Gunplay (Raycasting/Physics hit detection) and player movement</li>
								<li>Gameplay features such as difficulty options and power ups</li>
								<li>Custom made rooms in blender</li>
							</ul>

Do read the Appendices in the documentation for a guide on how to build the project in Unity or run the executable</p>
							<p>The final results achieved for the project: 73/100.</p>
